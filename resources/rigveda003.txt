*10.CLVIII:Surya*
1. MAY Surya guard us out of heaven, and Vāta from the firmament, And Agni from terrestrial spots.
2 Thou Savitar whose flame deserves hundred libations, be thou pleased: From failing lightning keep us safe.
3 May Savitar the God, and may Parvata also give us sight; May the Creator give us sight.
4 Give sight unto our eye, give thou our bodies sight that they may see: May we survey, discern this world.
5 Thus, Surya, may we look on thee, on thee most lovely to behold, See clearly with the eyes of men.
