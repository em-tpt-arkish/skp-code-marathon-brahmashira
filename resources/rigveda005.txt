*10.CLXXXIX:Surya*
1. THIS spotted Bull hath come, and sat before the Mother in the east, Advancing to his Father heaven.
2 Expiring when he draws his breath, she moves along the lucid spheres: The Bull shines out through all the sky.
3 Song is bestowed upon the Bird: it rules supreme through thirty realms, Throughout the days at break of morn.
